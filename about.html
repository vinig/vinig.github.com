<p>My name is Vini Gupta. I'm a graduate student at University of Southern California, Los Angeles where I'm studying Computer Science. I came to US in the year 2015. I worked for ThoughtWorks, Inc (India) for 4 years before I decided to take a break and expand my horizons in the field I care about. And a masters program seemed like a good way to go!</p>
